--------------------------------- CHANGE NOTES ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------- Version 1.1.0 ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]: [Fix] The function that is scanning for your distance from the Bounty
     Boards, was returning true and false at the time due to multiple coordinates
     inside the array. As you are close for 1 of the coords, it would immediately
     set the variable back to false as you are far away from the other coords.
     Thus if you have multiple locations, it will start to glitch.
     Now we are scanning for the location itself and setting that as your closest
     Bounty Board. You are now able to add multiple locations on the list without
     running in to troubles

[2]: [Fix] When multiple BountyBoards are on the list, and you are activating a
     bounty, it would activate 1 per BountyBoard on the list resulting in multiple
     bounties at once. I have added a extra check into the code so only 1 bounty
     activates per time you click on "Hunt Bounty".  However, you are still able
     to stack multiple bounties by activating the menu more times.

[3]: [REQUESTED]: Now you can set if you need a job(s) for hunting bounties.
     Instead of setting 1 job type, I have made it so that you can set multiple
     jobs in a list. If the user has any of these jobs he will be able to hunt
     for bounties. When he does not have the job, he will receive an error.

[4]: Added 2 more BountyBoard locations to the config.
