# Description
This plugin gives you a customizable Bounty System<br>
with many different hunts. When you open the menu<br>
you can open the PVE and PVP menu. Then you have <br>
the following options: Start a hunt, set a bounty<br>
and receiving your payment. When you start a bounty<br>
you will get a location on the map. Once all bounties<br>
are killed, you will receive instructions to search<br>
for the evidence on the last bounty you kill. Loot the<br>
body and you will get the objective to return to the<br>
sheriffs office. Here you can get your payment.<br>
The rewards are fully customizable and are effected <br>
by the amounts of bounty kills made ( Rewards x Kills ). <br>
You can set the minimal and maximum rewards in the config.<br>

# Disclaimer

Currently only the PVE section of the menu works, the PVP<br>

a later update. Also I will still be building more features <br>
into to this plugin, keep an eye on this repository to<br>
stay up to date with the latest version!
